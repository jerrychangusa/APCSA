        <p>Your Dragon Ball Z game is a two-player game where a human player will compete against a computer player in an epic fight! Both players start the game with zero energy points and three life points. The game ends when one player reaches zero life points or after 30 turns.</p>
<p>Every turn, both players must choose one of the following moves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charge Energy (+1 energy point)  🔋</li>
<li>Attack (-1 energy point)   ⚔️</li>
<li>Special Attack (-8 energy points) ⚡️</li>
<li>Defend (0 energy points)          🛡</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Players can only attack if they have charged up sufficient energy points.</p>
<p>The following table shows the result of a pair of moves chosen by two players:</p>
